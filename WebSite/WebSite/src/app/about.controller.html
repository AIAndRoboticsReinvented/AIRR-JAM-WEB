  <h2>Our Team</h2> 
  <h3>Jeremy Brasseaux: Management </h3>
  <p>
    My entrepreneur spirit began early on and throughout the years I have owned different businesses including an alarm company and a Golden Corral restaurant.  Despite my background being in electronics, management, and construction, real estate remained my passion. 
    I began my real estate career in 2004 on a part-time basis and in 2007 I entered the real estate arena full-time.  Some of my past real estate ventures includes owning rental properties, property management, flipping a mobile home park, and renovating and building single family homes.  Currently I own and manage rental properties, wholesale and renovate single family homes as well as building new homes. 
    I have a wealth of information and experience which I passionately share with others.  I am personally rewarded when I spend time talking with home owners, buyers, and investors and am able to help them reach their goals. 
    I built my businesses around systems which allows me to work efficiently and maximize precious time.  I enjoy seeing properties and bare land transformed into a beautiful, high quality designed homes that buyer’s desire. It has been an exciting trip and yet the journey has just begun!

  <h3>M.J. Sklaruk: Management </h3>
  <p>
    I have been investing in real estate over the past 16 years. I have been fortunate enough to work almost exclusively in the Tampa Bay market. I have experience in remodeling and retailing 100 plus properties. Also wholesaling 100's more, not excluding a few commercial buildings but mostly residential and even building a handful of homes.  
    The biggest attribute I consider a strength is my ability to communicate with and serve my clients interests, as it pertains to them finding a bargain home to live in or as an investment to profit upon. I enjoy helping people achieve their goals, plus assist someone to finding their new home at an affordable price, one that may not otherwise be able to buy, then that's very rewarding.

  <h3>Russ Brantmyer: Acquisitions Director </h3>
  <p>
    I'm a Tampa native and knew very early on that  
    sales and marketing would become a true passion of mine in my formative  
    years. I worked for years in credit repair and the mortgage industry in  
    a national capacity. With a strong construction background, I was driven  
    to begin my journey in investing 15 plus years ago. I have always been  
    an entrepreneur at heart with a strong desire to excel. 
    In the past, I have mentored in the real estate investing business. I  
    enjoy helping those who want a lot for themselves and strive to become  
    independently wealthy. Over my years of mentoring I managed to stumble  
    across a large variety of real estate transaction types.
    My goal is to be able to develop many long-term purposeful relationships in the real  
    estate industry that will have an everlasting impact on the upcoming  
    generations in the Tampa Bay area. I enjoy helping families and other  
    Real Estate professionals meet in the middle for a transaction that is  
    conducive to everyone.

  <p>
    I was born in central Florida but made Tampa Bay my home in the early part of 2016. I attended college at the University of Florida where I began the Registered Nursing program and as I reached completion realized the field was not for me. I then began the process of transitioning into a MBA program of which I will complete in the next year. I have a strong background for office management and business administration and have spent the majority of my career managing contractors for IBM until my recent transition into the real estate industry.
